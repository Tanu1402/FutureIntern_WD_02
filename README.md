Porfolio Website

You can create a personal portfolio with the basic
skills in CSS and HTML. This is yet again, one of the
most common projects on web development for
beginners. In a personal portfolio, you get to show a
wide range of samples and skills and add your
resume. You can add an image at the top where you
can introduce yourself; below that, you can add
contact information.
